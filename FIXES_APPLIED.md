# Fixes Applied - October 21, 2025

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. Reddit OAuth Authentication (FIXED)
**Problem:** Reddit API was returning 401 Unauthorized when trying to refresh access token and post comments.

**Root Cause:** The User-Agent header had a hardcoded username `u/Commercial_Term_8918` which didn't match the actual Reddit account `yadidiahhumaiae`.

**Solution:** Updated User-Agent to dynamically use the REDDIT_USERNAME environment variable:
- Line 81 in `reddit_bot.js`: Changed to `RedditBot/2.0 (by /u/${username})`
- Line 153 in `reddit_bot.js`: Changed to `RedditBot/2.0 (by /u/${process.env.REDDIT_USERNAME})`

**Files Modified:**
- `/app/reddit_bot.js`

---

### 2. Twitter Automated Login Password Field Detection (FIXED)
**Problem:** The automated Twitter login was failing because it couldn't find the password field after entering the username.

**Root Cause:** 
- Insufficient wait time after clicking "Next" button
- No retry logic for finding the password field
- Twitter's dynamic page loading requires more patience

**Solution:** 
- Increased wait time from 2 seconds to 3 seconds
- Added retry loop (5 attempts with 2-second delays between attempts)
- Added explicit `waitForSelector` with timeout handling
- Added error handling with `.catch()` to prevent crashes
- Added screenshot capture on failure for debugging
- Better visibility and type checking for password fields

**Files Modified:**
- `/app/twitter_bot.js` (lines 230-279)

---

### 3. Port 4000 EADDRINUSE Error (FIXED)
**Problem:** When Twitter authentication failed, subsequent attempts crashed with "Error: listen EADDRINUSE: address already in use :::4000"

**Root Cause:** 
- The OAuth callback server on port 4000 was not being properly closed when authentication failed
- No tracking of server instance across function calls
- No cleanup in error paths

**Solution:**
- Added global variable `oauthCallbackServer` to track server instance
- Added server cleanup before starting new authentication attempt
- Added server cleanup in error catch blocks
- Added error handling for EADDRINUSE in server startup
- Properly reject Promise when port is already in use

**Files Modified:**
- `/app/twitter_bot.js` (lines 26, 456-518, 522-556)

## Additional Issues Noted (Not Fixed)

### Reddit Search API Blocking
**Status:** Expected behavior, already has fallback

The logs show:
```
Response Status: 403 Blocked
‚ö†Ô∏è  Reddit is blocking requests from this server IP.
üí° This is common for cloud/datacenter IPs.
```

**Why not fixed:** This is a Reddit infrastructure policy that blocks cloud/datacenter IPs. The code already has a Puppeteer fallback, but that also gets blocked because it's still coming from the same IP.

**Potential solutions (requires user decision):**
1. Use a proxy service with residential IPs
2. Use Reddit OAuth API exclusively (already implemented for posting)
3. Accept that search won't work from cloud servers

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Test Reddit OAuth:**
   - Restart the Docker container
   - Try posting a comment to verify the 401 error is resolved
   - Check if the User-Agent fix allows successful token refresh

2. **Test Twitter Login:**
   - Trigger a Twitter comment request
   - Monitor logs for password field detection
   - Check if screenshots are created at `/app/twitter-login-error.png` if it fails

3. **Test Port Cleanup:**
   - Trigger two consecutive failed Twitter authentications
   - Verify no EADDRINUSE error occurs on the second attempt
   - Check logs for "Closing existing OAuth callback server" messages

## Environment Variables to Verify

Make sure these are set correctly in your `.env` file:

```bash
# Reddit
REDDIT_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id
REDDIT_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret
REDDIT_USERNAME=yadidiahhumaiae
REDDIT_PASSWORD=your_password

# Twitter/X
X_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id
X_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret
TWITTER_USER=your_email_or_username
TWITTER_PASS=your_password
TWITTER_USERNAME=your_twitter_handle
X_USER=your_email_or_username
X_PASS=your_password
X_USERNAME=your_twitter_handle
```

---

## Next Steps

1. Rebuild and restart the Docker container:
   ```bash
   docker-compose down
   docker-compose up --build -d
   docker-compose logs -f
   ```

2. Test the Reddit comment functionality

3. Test the Twitter comment functionality

4. Monitor logs for any remaining issues
