# Fixes Applied - October 21, 2025

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. Reddit OAuth Authentication (FIXED)
**Problem:** Reddit API was returning 401 Unauthorized when trying to refresh access token and post comments.

**Root Cause:** The User-Agent header had a hardcoded username `u/Commercial_Term_8918` which didn't match the actual Reddit account `yadidiahhumaiae`.

**Solution:** Updated User-Agent to dynamically use the REDDIT_USERNAME environment variable:
- Line 81 in `reddit_bot.js`: Changed to `RedditBot/2.0 (by /u/${username})`
- Line 153 in `reddit_bot.js`: Changed to `RedditBot/2.0 (by /u/${process.env.REDDIT_USERNAME})`

**Files Modified:**
- `/app/reddit_bot.js`

---

## Additional Issues Noted (Not Fixed)

### 1. Twitter Authentication Errors (NOT FIXED - Not in Use)
**Status:** Your n8n workflow is calling `/api/twitter/comment` which uses `twitter_bot.js` with OAuth API.

**Note:** If you're not using Twitter API (and using Puppeteer instead), update your n8n workflow to call `/api/twitter2/comment` instead.

### 2. Reddit Search API Blocking
**Status:** Expected behavior, already has fallback

The logs show:
```
Response Status: 403 Blocked
‚ö†Ô∏è  Reddit is blocking requests from this server IP.
üí° This is common for cloud/datacenter IPs.
```

**Why not fixed:** This is a Reddit infrastructure policy that blocks cloud/datacenter IPs. The code already has a Puppeteer fallback, but that also gets blocked because it's still coming from the same IP.

**Potential solutions (requires user decision):**
1. Use a proxy service with residential IPs
2. Use Reddit OAuth API exclusively (already implemented for posting)
3. Accept that search won't work from cloud servers

---

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Test Reddit OAuth:**
   - Restart the Docker container
   - Try posting a comment to verify the 401 error is resolved
   - Check if the User-Agent fix allows successful token refresh

---

## Environment Variables to Verify

Make sure these are set correctly in your `.env` file:

```bash
# Reddit
REDDIT_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id
REDDIT_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret
REDDIT_USERNAME=yadidiahhumaiae
REDDIT_PASSWORD=your_password
```

---

## Next Steps

1. Rebuild and restart the Docker container:
   ```bash
   docker-compose down
   docker-compose up --build -d
   docker-compose logs -f
   ```

2. Test the Reddit comment functionality

3. If using Twitter, make sure your n8n workflow calls `/api/twitter2/comment` (Puppeteer) instead of `/api/twitter/comment` (OAuth API)

4. Monitor logs for any remaining issues
