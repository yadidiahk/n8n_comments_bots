# ⚡ Quick Fix Summary - Twitter Login & Chromium

## What Was Fixed

### 1. ❌ → ✅ Fixed `require is not defined` Error
**Changed in 3 files:**
- `twitter_puppeteer_bot.js`
- `bot.js`  
- `tiktok_bot.js`

**Fix:** Added `import { execSync } from "child_process"` at the top

### 2. 🎭 Made Chromium Much More Stealthy

**Added anti-detection features:**
- Removed webdriver property completely
- Added realistic browser plugins
- Latest Chrome 131 user agent
- Hid all automation flags
- Added realistic hardware specs (8GB RAM, 8 CPUs)
- Masked all Chrome APIs properly

### 3. 🔍 Smarter Twitter Verification Handling

**Now detects what Twitter is asking for:**
- Phone number → Wait for manual entry
- Email → Enter email automatically
- Username → Enter username/handle automatically
- Shows preview of what Twitter wants in logs
- Checks if password field appears after verification
- Waits longer if needed
