# TikTok Rate Limit Fix Guide

## üîç Problem Identified

Your TikTok account has been **rate-limited** by TikTok due to multiple failed automated login attempts. The error message is:

```
Maximum number of attempts reached. Try again later.
```

**This is NOT a password issue** - TikTok has temporarily blocked login attempts from your IP/account combination.

## ‚úÖ Solution: Manual Login to Save Session

Instead of automated login, we'll do a **one-time manual login** to save your session. Then the bot won't need to login again.

### Step 1: Run the Manual Login Helper

```bash
node tiktok-manual-login.js
```

### Step 2: Login Manually in the Browser

1. A browser window will open automatically
2. **Login manually** with your TikTok credentials
3. Complete any verification (CAPTCHA, email, SMS)
4. Wait until you see your TikTok feed/homepage
5. The script will auto-detect when you're logged in

### Step 3: Session Saved!

Once logged in, your session is saved in the `tiktok_profile` folder. The bot will now work without needing to login again!

## üîÑ Alternative Solutions

If the manual login doesn't work, try these:

### Option 1: Wait and Retry
```bash
# Wait 30 minutes, then try the manual login again
# TikTok's rate limit is usually temporary
```

### Option 2: Clear Profile and Start Fresh
```bash
# Delete the old profile data
rm -rf tiktok_profile

# Then run manual login
node tiktok-manual-login.js
```

### Option 3: Use Different Network
- Try connecting to a different WiFi network
- Use your phone's hotspot
- Use a VPN to change your IP address

### Option 4: Use Incognito/Different Browser First
Sometimes logging in via your regular browser (incognito mode) first can help reset the rate limit on your account.

## üéØ How to Test

After completing the manual login, test the bot:

```bash
# Test with a TikTok video URL
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/tiktok/comment \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "videoUrl": "YOUR_TIKTOK_VIDEO_URL",
    "commentText": "Test comment!"
  }'
```

## üõ°Ô∏è Preventing Future Rate Limits

1. **Don't delete `tiktok_profile` folder** - It contains your saved session
2. **Avoid multiple login attempts** - The bot now checks if already logged in
3. **Use manual login when needed** - If session expires, use `tiktok-manual-login.js` again

---

## üìù Technical Details

**Why This Happened:**
- Multiple automated login attempts triggered TikTok's anti-bot protection
